# Resolution Summary: Linear Issue LFE-7112

**Issue Title:** Self-hosted custom base path docs misses important changes to make for Helm deployments  
**Issue ID:** LFE-7112  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**  
**Resolution Date:** October 8, 2025  

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved a critical documentation gap that was causing deployment failures for users deploying Langfuse with custom base paths using Helm. Created comprehensive documentation, working examples, and updated the main README to guide users through the required probe configuration changes.

## The Problem

The existing custom base path documentation provided general guidance but **omitted critical Helm/Kubernetes-specific requirements**: updating `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` paths to include the custom base path prefix.

**Impact without this fix:**
- Pods crash with `CrashLoopBackOff`
- Pods never become `Ready`, causing 503 errors
- Hours of debugging time lost
- Deployment failures in production

## The Solution

Created comprehensive documentation and examples that clearly explain the Helm-specific requirements for custom base path deployments.

### Files Created

#### 1. **`docs/CUSTOM_BASE_PATH_HELM.md`** (278 lines)

- Overview and prerequisites
- Environment variable configuration
- **Probe configuration requirements** (the critical missing piece)
- Complete working example with both web and worker services
- Ingress configuration
- Verification steps
- Troubleshooting guide for common issues
- Links to additional resources

## The Critical Fix - What Users Need to Know

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

```yaml
web:
  env:
    - name: NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH
      value: "/langfuse"
  
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /api/public/health  # ‚Üê WRONG: Missing base path prefix
      port: 3000
```

### ‚úÖ What Works

```yaml
web:
  env:
    - name: NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH
      value: "/langfuse"
  
  livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /langfuse/api/public/health  # ‚Üê CORRECT: Includes base path prefix
      port: 3000
  
  readinessProbe:
    httpGet:
      path: /langfuse/api/public/ready   # ‚Üê CORRECT: Includes base path prefix
      port: 3000
```

### üìù Key Points

1. **Web service** health checks MUST include the custom base path prefix
2. **Worker service** health checks do NOT include the base path prefix
3. Both `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe` must be updated
4. The path must match the `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH` environment variable exactly

## Technical Details

### Health Check Endpoints

**Web Service (requires base path prefix):**
```
Default:     /api/public/health
With prefix: /your-base-path/api/public/health

Default:     /api/public/ready
With prefix: /your-base-path/api/public/ready
```

**Worker Service (no base path prefix):**
```
Always:      /api/health
Always:      /api/ready
```

### Why This Configuration is Critical

Kubernetes uses these probes to:
1. **Liveness Probe** - Determine if the pod is healthy (restart if not)
2. **Readiness Probe** - Determine if the pod should receive traffic

Without correct probe paths:
- Kubernetes can't reach the health endpoints (404 error)
- Liveness checks fail ‚Üí pods restart continuously
- Readiness checks fail ‚Üí pods never receive traffic
- Service becomes unavailable (503 errors)
