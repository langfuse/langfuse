## Making a change

_Before making any significant changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues)._ Discussing your proposed changes ahead of time will make the contribution process smooth for everyone. Large changes that were not discussed in an issue may be rejected.

Once we've discussed your changes and you've got your code ready, make sure that tests are passing and open your pull request.

A good first step is to search for open [issues](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues). Issues are labeled, and some good issues to start with are labeled: [good first issue](https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).

### Database Overview

The diagram below may not show all relationships if the foreign key is not defined in the database schema. For instance, `trace_id` in the `observation` table is not defined as a foreign key to the `trace` table to allow unordered ingestion of these objects, but it is still a foreign key in the application code.

Full database schema: [packages/shared/prisma/schema.prisma](packages/shared/prisma/schema.prisma)

## Repository Structure

We built a monorepo using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/motivation) and [turbo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs) to manage the dependencies and build process. The monorepo contains the following packages:

- `web`: is the main application package providing Frontend and Backend APIs for Langfuse.
- `worker` (no production yet): contains an application for asynchronous processing of tasks. This package is not yet used in production.
- `packages`:
  - `shared`: contains shared code between the above packages.
  - `config-eslint`: contains eslint configurations which are shared between the above packages.
  - `config-typescript`: contains typescript configurations which are shared between the above packages.
- `ee`: contains all enterprise features. See [EE README](ee/README.md) for more details.

## Development Setup

Requirements

- Node.js 20 as specified in the [.nvmrc](.nvmrc)
- Docker to run the database locally

**Steps**

1. Fork the the repository and clone it locally
2. Run the development database

   ```bash
   pnpm run infra:dev:up
   ```

3. Create an env file

   ```bash
    cp .env.dev.example .env
   ```

4. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

5. Run the migrations

   All database migrations and configs are in the `shared` package.

   ```bash
   pnpm --filter=shared run db:migrate

   # Optional: seed the database
   # pnpm run db:seed
   # pnpm run db:seed:examples
   # pnpm --filter=shared run db:seed:load
   ```

6. Start the development server

   ```bash
    pnpm run dev
   ```

## Monorepo quickstart

- Available packages and their dependencies

  Packages are included in the monorepo according to the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file. Each package maintains its own dependencies defined in the `package.json`. Internal dependencies can be added as well by adding them to the package dependencies: `"@langfuse/shared": "workspace:*"`.

- Executing commands

  You can run commands in all packages at once. For example, to install all dependencies in all packages, you can execute:

  ```bash
  pnpm install
  pnpm run dev
  pnpm --filter=web run dev # execute command only in one package
  ```

  In the root `package.json`, you can find scripts which are executed with turbo e.g. `turbo run dev`. These scripts are executed with the help of Turbo. Turbo executes the commands in all packages taking care of the correct order of execution. Task definitions can be found in the `turbo.config.js` file.

- Run migrations

  To run migrations, you can execute the following command.

  ```bash
  pnpm run db:migrate -- --name <name of the migration>
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> If you frequently switch branches, use `pnpm run dx` instead of `pnpm run dev`. This command will install dependencies, reset the database (wipe and apply all migrations), and run the database seeder with example data before starting the development server.

> [!NOTE]
> If you find yourself stuck and want to clean the repo, execute `pnpm run nuke`. It will remove all node_modules and build files.

## System behavior

### Ingestion API `(/public/api/ingestion)`

- the ingestion API takes different event types (creation and updates of traces, generations, spans, events)
- The API loops through each event and:
  - validates the event
  - stores the event raw in the events table
  - calculates tokens for `generations`
  - matches models from the `models` table to model for `generations` events
  - upserts the event in the `traces` or `observations` table
- returns a `207` HTTP status code with a list of errors if any event failed to be ingested

## Commit messages

On the main branch, we adhere to the best practices of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). All pull requests and branches are squash-merged to maintain a clean and readable history. This approach ensures the addition of a conventional commit message when merging contributions.

## Test the public API

The API is tested using Jest. With the development server running, you can run the tests with:

Run all

```bash
npm run test
```

Run interactively in watch mode

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

These tests are also run in CI.

## CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, the configuration is in [`.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`](.github/workflows/pipeline.yml)

CI on `main` and `pull_request`

- Check Linting
- E2E test of API using Jest
- E2E tests of UI using Playwright

CD on `main`

- Publish Docker image to GitHub Packages if CI passes. Done on every push to `main` branch. Only released versions are tagged with `latest`.

## Staging environment

We run a staging environment at [https://staging.langfuse.com](https://staging.langfuse.com) that is automatically deployed on every push to `main` branch.

The same environment is also used for preview deployments of pull requests. Limitations:

- SSO is not available as dynamic domains are not supported by most SSO providers.
- When making changes to the database, migrations to the staging database need to be applied manually by a maintainer. If you want to interactively test database changes in the staging environment, please reach out.

You can use the staging environment end-to-end with the Langfuse integrations or SDKs (host: `https://staging.langfuse.com`). However, please note that the staging environment is not intended for production use and may be reset at any time.

## Production environment

When a new release is tagged on the `main` branch (excluding prereleases), it triggers a production deployment. The deployment process consists of two steps:

1. The Docker image is published to GitHub Packages with the version number and `latest` tag.
2. The deployment is carried out on Langfuse Cloud. This is done by force pushing the `main` branch to the `production` branch during every release, using the [`release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml) GitHub Action.
