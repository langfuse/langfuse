## Experimental Setup with AggregatingMergeTrees

Warn: Do not apply on your own as this is highly experimental and may change anytime.

To reduce the costs associated with trace processing, we aim to derive trace information from spans eventually.
As a first step, we created a `traces_mt` table which acted as a proxy for a bunch of AggregatingMergeTrees that collapse
trace writes into a single row.
We have now moved to a `traces_null` table that doesn't store intermediate results to save on storage and compute overhead.

We can enable experimental writes to the `traces_null` table by setting `LANGFUSE_EXPERIMENT_INSERT_INTO_AGGREGATING_MERGE_TREES=true`.
This requires that the following table schema is manually applied on the database instance:

FROM traces_null tn
GROUP BY project_id, id;
```

## Query AggregatingMergeTrees

We can query the properties of the resulting AggregatingMergeTree via (make sure to pick the right timeframe:

```sql
SELECT
  -- Identifiers
  project_id,
  id,
  start_time,
  end_time,
  name,

  -- Metadata properties
  metadata,
  user_id,
  session_id,
  environment,
  tags,
  version,
  release,

  -- UI properties
  finalizeAggregation(bookmarked) AS bookmarked_value,
  finalizeAggregation(public) AS public_value,

  -- Aggregations
  observation_ids,
  score_ids,
  cost_details,
  usage_details,

  -- Input/Output
  finalizeAggregation(input) AS input_value,
  finalizeAggregation(output) AS output_value,

  created_at,
  updated_at
FROM traces_all_amt
LIMIT 100;
```

## Find discrepancies

We can identify discrepancies in the original and the new data using

```sql
-- Query to compare traces_all_amt with traces table and identify discrepancies
WITH amt_data AS (
-- First get the finalized values from the AMT table
  SELECT project_id,
         id,
         start_time,
         end_time,
         name,

         metadata,
         user_id,
         session_id,
         environment,
         tags,
         version,
         release,

         finalizeAggregation(bookmarked) AS bookmarked_value,
         finalizeAggregation(public) AS public_value,

         finalizeAggregation(input) AS input_value,
         finalizeAggregation(output) AS output_value,

         created_at,
         updated_at
  FROM traces_all_amt

## Traces Table Access Pattern Checklist

This checklist documents all references and invocations to the `traces` table grouped by their access pattern. Use this as a baseline to perform transformations like the one in `@/packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts` with the `measureAndReturn` utility.

### 1. Single Record Lookups (by ID)

- [ ] **IngestionService.getClickhouseRecord()** - `worker/src/services/IngestionService/index.ts:1047-1065`
  - Can probably be skipped as read for updates won't be a thing in the new flow.
- [x] **getTraceById()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:443-486`
- [x] **getTracesByIds()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:233-264`

### 2. Session-Based Queries

- [x] **getTracesBySessionId()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:266-304`
- [x] **getTracesIdentifierForSession()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:642-688`

### 3. Existence Checks

- [x] **checkTraceExists()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:73-210`
- [x] **hasAnyTrace()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:306-356`
- [x] **hasAnyUser()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:763-787`

### 4. Aggregation and Analytics Queries

- [ ] **getTracesCountForPublicApi()** - `web/src/features/public-api/server/traces.ts:299`
- [ ] **generateDailyMetrics()** - `web/src/features/public-api/server/dailyMetrics.ts:93`
- [ ] **getDailyMetricsCount()** - `web/src/features/public-api/server/dailyMetrics.ts:153`
- [x] **generateObservationsForPublicApi()** - `web/src/features/public-api/server/observations.ts:80`
- [x] **getObservationsCountForPublicApi()** - `web/src/features/public-api/server/observations.ts:108`
- [x] **getObservationsTableInternal()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/observations.ts:565`
- [x] **_handleGenerateScoresForPublicApi()** - `web/src/features/public-api/server/scores.ts:101`
- [x] **_handleGetScoresCountForPublicApi()** - `web/src/features/public-api/server/scores.ts:181`
- [x] **getScoresUiGeneric()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/scores.ts:825`
- [ ] **getNumericScoreHistogram()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/scores.ts:1074`
- [x] **getTracesGroupedByName()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:489-535`
- [x] **getTracesGroupedByUsers()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:537-597`
- [x] **getTracesGroupedByTags()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:605-640`
- [x] **getTotalUserCount()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:789-827`
- [x] **getUserMetrics()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:829-978`
- [x] **getTracesTableGeneric()** - `packages/shared/src/server/services/traces-ui-table-service.ts:207++`
- [x] **getSessionsTableGeneric()** - `packages/shared/src/server/services/sessions-ui-table-service.ts:121++`)
- [x] **generateTracesForPublicApi()** - `web/src/features/public-api/server/traces.ts:36++`

### 5. Data Export and Migration

Note: The measureAndReturn utility does not handle query streams well as it promisifies everything.
We need to cover these queries manually and cannot run a comparison.
We could use an opt-in on a projectId basis.

- [ ] **getTracesForPostHog()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:1026-1113`
- [ ] **getScoresForPostHog()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/scores.ts:1328`
- [ ] **getGenerationsForPosthog()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/observations.ts:1481`
- [ ] **getTracesForBlobStorageExport()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:980-1024`

### 6. Count and Statistics Queries

- [x] **getTraceCountsByProjectInCreationInterval()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:358-392`
- [x] **getTraceCountOfProjectsSinceCreationDate()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:394-423`

### 7. Cross-Project Queries

- [x] **getTracesByIdsForAnyProject()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:1115-1141`

### 8. Delete Operations
- [x] **deleteTraces()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:790++`
- [x] **deleteTracesOlderThanDays()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:814++`
- [x] **deleteTracesByProjectId()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:841++`

### 9. Writes

- [x] **upsertTrace()** - `packages/shared/src/server/repositories/traces.ts:224`
