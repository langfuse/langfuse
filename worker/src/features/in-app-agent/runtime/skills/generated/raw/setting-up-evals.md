# Setting up evals

- **Act as executor and teacher.** Do the work and, above all, explain why the approach fits the user's goal and data.
- **Teach decision-making, not configuration.** Explain the reasoning, tradeoffs, and limitations—not sampling rates, targets, score types, or other setup details. The response must leave the user able to repeat or change the approach and make future decisions without you.

Always read [Choosing what to evaluate](https://langfuse.com/academy/evaluate/choosing-what-to-evaluate) and [Evaluation](https://langfuse.com/academy/evaluate). Use their guidance to interpret their project, but do not return it as a generic setup plan.

If the user has a precise metric, skip to **Build the evaluator**. Otherwise, do not assume that choosing evaluator metrics is the next step.

## Find the measurement gap

Before advising:

- Inspect enough representative traces to present concrete findings of your own before asking about metrics.
- Inventory existing datasets, evaluators, traces, etc. as context; do not assume they should be reused or represent a current priority. Treat their importance as unconfirmed until the user agrees.
- Identify what is already surfaced through trace errors, logged data, existing scores, or other monitoring; what is available but not monitored; what important user or product signals are not captured; and what genuinely requires an evaluator.
- Do not ask the user for information you can inspect.
- If project access is unavailable, say so instead of substituting a generic plan.

Do not add an evaluator that duplicates an existing error or logged signal. For example, do not evaluate valid JSON when invalid JSON already produces a trace error.

Treat trace errors and logged failures as existing coverage. Unless the user wants operational monitoring, do not let them displace the search for subtler qualitative signals that are not yet captured. Do not propose alerts, paging, or release gates before asking how the measurement should be used.

Do not propose evaluating a known failure with an owner and a planned one-time fix unless the user wants to track whether it recurs.

If formal error analysis is the right next step, explain why and ask whether the user wants to do it. If they agree, run it following `references/error-analysis.md`, and do not start metric selection until the analysis is complete.

## Define the metric set

Existing project materials inform the questions you'll ask; it does not determine what the user values.

When forming tentative recommendations:

- Start with direct evidence of user or product outcomes, recurring failures visible in traces or user reactions, and important signals the application is not yet capturing.
- Prefer quick wins: signals that are application-specific, actionable, reasonably reliable to start measuring. A good example signal is user (dis)satisfaction.
- Recommend metrics only for problems evidenced in current data. A behavior being common or theoretically risky is not a reason to run an evaluator.
- For live evaluation, recommend only metrics that can be scored from the available live data without ground truth; never suggest a metric that requires knowing the correct answer, expected outcome, or ideal resolution.
- Do not propose generic starting metrics such as `helpfulness`, `quality`, `relevance`, `hallucination`, `groundedness`, `task completion`, `task success`, or `reliability`.
- Before presenting any metric, verify that it can actually be measured using the available data and Langfuse's supported evaluator inputs. If not, identify what must be captured instead.
- Explain why each recommendation deserves attention before the alternatives, then ask the user whether that priority matches their goals.

When specific failures or hard requirements are known and metric selection is the next task, ask focused, dependent questions about which ones matter and what decisions their measurement should support. Give a recommendation grounded in the project, leave the decision to the user, and wait for their answer.

Do not treat any metric as selected, choose evaluator types, ask implementation questions, or implement anything until the user has answered and explicitly confirmed the metric set.

## Build the evaluator

For evaluator functionality, use the unstable API endpoints.

Follow [Writing good evaluators](https://langfuse.com/academy/evaluate/writing-evaluators) to choose the evaluator type; do not always default to an LLM-as-a-judge.

- Explain why the chosen evaluation method measures the intended behavior, what evidence it relies on, what it cannot tell the user, and when another method would be better.
- When methods have significant trade-offs and none is clearly superior, explain the options and let the user decide before implementation.
- Only if an LLM-as-a-judge is the best fit, calibrate it on real examples before treating it as ready(`references/judge-calibration.md`). You can do this by running an experiment on a dataset where the prompt being tested is the LLM-as-a-judge prompt.
- Share a link to the evaluator.
