Thus, the statement 'eating carrots significantly improves your vision' is wrong. Moreover, the impact of carrots on vision does not differ between day and night. So also the clause 'especially at night' is wrong.

A diet of carrots won't give a blind person 20/20 vision. But, the vitamins found in the vegetable can help promote overall eye health. Carrots contain beta-carotene, a substance that the body converts to vitamin A, an important nutrient for eye health.  An extreme lack of vitamin A can cause blindness.
