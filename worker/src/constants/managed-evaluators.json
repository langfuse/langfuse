This is why people who eat lots of carrots never need glasses. Anyone who tells you otherwise is probably trying to sell you expensive eyewear or doesn't want you to benefit from this simple, natural remedy. It's shocking how the eyewear industry has led to a widespread belief that vegetables like carrots don't help your vision. People are so gullible to fall for these money-making schemes.\n\nScore: 1.0\nReasoning: Carrots only improve vision under specific circumstances, namely a lack of vitamin A that leads to decreased vision. Thus, the statement 'eating carrots significantly improves your vision' is wrong. Moreover, the impact of carrots on vision does not differ between day and night. So also the clause 'especially is night' is wrong. Any of the following comments on people trying to sell glasses and the eyewear industry cannot be supported in any kind.\n\nInput:\nQuery: {{query}}\nGeneration: {{generation}}\n\nThink step by step."

A diet of carrots won't give a blind person 20/20 vision. But, the vitamins found in the vegetable can help promote overall eye health. Carrots contain beta-carotene, a substance that the body converts to vitamin A, an important nutrient for eye health.  An extreme lack of vitamin A can cause blindness. Vitamin A can prevent the formation of cataracts and macular degeneration, the world's leading cause of blindness. However, if your vision problems aren't related to vitamin A, your vision won't change no matter how many carrots you eat.\nScore: 0.1\nReasoning: While the generation mentions that carrots can improve vision, it fails to outline the reason for this phenomenon and the circumstances under which this is the case.
