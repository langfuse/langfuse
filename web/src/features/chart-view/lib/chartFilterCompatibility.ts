/**
 * Which of the events table's sidebar/search filters a chart can honour, and a
 * human reason for the ones it can't.
 *
 * The chart runs the observations aggregate query (`dashboard.executeQuery`,
 * v2 events read path — see `buildChartQuery`). That query accepts a subset of
 * the columns the events table exposes as filters: the dimensions the widget
 * builder also offers (LFE-10751). Everything else — measures, scores,
 * comments, metadata, and a few structural columns — has no dimension to filter
 * on, so it CANNOT be applied to the chart.
 *
 * Rather than hide the chart when an unsupported filter is present (the old
 * all-or-nothing gate), we forward what we can and mark the rest as "not
 * applied" in the sidebar + search bar, with the reason on hover. This module
 * is the single source of truth for that split — pure, unit-tested, shared by
 * the query builder (what to forward), the add-to-dashboard mapper (what the
 * saved widget carries), and both filter surfaces (what to deactivate).
