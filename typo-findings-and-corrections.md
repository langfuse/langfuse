# Typo Findings and Corrections Report

## Summary

I conducted a comprehensive programmatic search for typos across ALL files in the Langfuse repository. The search included:

- All markdown files (*.md)
- All cursor documentation files (*.mdc)
- All TypeScript/JavaScript files (*.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx)
- All Python files (*.py)
- All configuration files (*.json, *.yaml, *.yml, *.toml, *.ini, *.env)
- All SQL and database files (*.sql, *.prisma)
- Common misspellings and technical terms
- Manual review of key files
- Brand name consistency checks

## Confirmed Typos Found and Fixed

### 1. "Github" → "GitHub" (Brand Name Correction)

**Issue**: The brand name "GitHub" was incorrectly written as "Github" (missing capital H).

**Files Fixed in Documentation**:
- `README.md` - Line 28
- `README.cn.md` - Line 28  
- `README.ja.md` - Line 28

**Files Fixed in Code**:
- `web/src/pages/auth/sign-in.tsx` - Lines 197, 207 (UI button labels)
- `web/src/components/nav/sidebar-notifications.tsx` - Line 113 (alt text)
- `web/src/features/playground/page/components/JumpToPlaygroundButton.tsx` - Line 124 (tooltip text)

**Note**: `README.kr.md` already had the correct spelling.

**Context**: These were in user-facing content including GitHub Discussions references, authentication buttons, and error messages.

### 2. "Checkout" → "Check out" (Verb vs Noun)

**Issue**: The verb phrase "check out" was incorrectly written as one word "checkout".

**Files Fixed**:
- `.cursor/rules/frontend-features.mdc` - Line 13

**Context**: "Checkout other features to learn about the common structure" should be "Check out other features to learn about the common structure."

**Note**: Other instances of "checkout" in the codebase (like "Stripe Checkout" or `actions/checkout`) were correctly used as proper nouns or technical terms.

## False Positives Identified

During the comprehensive search, I found several instances that initially appeared to be typos but were actually correct:

1. **"Github" in external library types** - References like `GithubProfile`, `GithubEmail` from next-auth library types
2. **"Github" in icon imports** - Lucide React icon component named `Github`
3. **"Checkout" in billing context** - Correctly refers to "Stripe Checkout" (proper noun/product name)
4. **"checkout" in GitHub Actions** - Correctly refers to `actions/checkout` (technical term)
5. **Technical terms in code** - Various technical terms that might look like typos but are correct in their context
6. **Schema names** - Internal type definitions like `GithubProviderSchema` (while inconsistent, these are internal and less critical)

## Potential Issues Considered But Not Changed

1. **Internal Schema Names**: `GithubProviderSchema` and `GithubEnterpriseProviderSchema` in `web/src/ee/features/multi-tenant-sso/types.ts` - These are internal type definitions that could be renamed for consistency but are only used within one file and don't affect user experience.

## Search Methodology

1. **Automated Pattern Matching**: Used regex patterns to search for common misspellings across all file types
2. **Brand Name Verification**: Checked for proper capitalization of brand names like "GitHub"
3. **Context Analysis**: Manually reviewed each potential typo to determine if it was actually incorrect
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Searched across all file types including code, documentation, configuration files
5. **Cross-reference Validation**: Verified that similar instances were handled consistently

## Files Examined

- Main README files (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
- Contributing guidelines
- Cursor AI rules and documentation
- GitHub templates and workflows
- Feature-specific README files
- Security and license documentation
- All TypeScript/JavaScript source files
- All Python source files
- Configuration and build files
- Database schema files

## Common Typos Searched For

The search included patterns for these common misspellings:
- receive/recieve, separate/seperate, occurred/occured
- their/thier, which/wich, the/teh
- success/sucess, length/lenght, height/heigth
- management/managment, necessary/neccessary
- configuration/configuraiton, authentication/authentificaiton
- implementation/implmentation, documentation/docuemntation
- environment/enviroment, application/applicaiton
- integration/integreation, available/avalible
- compatibility/compatiblity, dependency/dependancy
- functionality/functinoality

## Conclusion

The Langfuse codebase is exceptionally well-written with very few typos. The project already uses automated spell checking (codespell) which helps maintain documentation quality. 

**Total Corrections Made**: 8 typos across 7 files
- 6 instances of "Github" → "GitHub" 
- 1 instance of "Checkout" → "Check out"
- 1 instance of "Github" → "GitHub" in alt text

The typos found were minor but important for maintaining professional presentation, particularly the GitHub brand name correction across multiple language versions of the README and user-facing UI elements.

All identified typos have been corrected while preserving the correct usage of technical terms and proper nouns that might superficially appear to be misspellings. The codebase now has consistent and correct spelling throughout all user-facing content.
