# Typo Findings and Corrections Report

## Summary

I conducted a comprehensive programmatic search for typos across all documentation files in the Langfuse repository. The search included:

- All markdown files (*.md)
- All cursor documentation files (*.mdc)
- Common misspellings and technical terms
- Manual review of key documentation files

## Confirmed Typos Found and Fixed

### 1. "Github" → "GitHub" (Brand Name Correction)

**Issue**: The brand name "GitHub" was incorrectly written as "Github" (missing capital H).

**Files Fixed**:
- `README.md` - Line 28
- `README.cn.md` - Line 28  
- `README.ja.md` - Line 28

**Note**: `README.kr.md` already had the correct spelling.

**Context**: These occurrences were in the sentence referring to "GitHub Discussions" for support and feature requests.

### 2. "Checkout" → "Check out" (Verb vs Noun)

**Issue**: The verb phrase "check out" was incorrectly written as one word "checkout".

**Files Fixed**:
- `.cursor/rules/frontend-features.mdc` - Line 13

**Context**: "Checkout other features to learn about the common structure" should be "Check out other features to learn about the common structure."

**Note**: Other instances of "checkout" in the codebase (like "Stripe Checkout" or `actions/checkout`) were correctly used as proper nouns or technical terms.

## False Positives Identified

During the search, I found several instances that initially appeared to be typos but were actually correct:

1. **"Checkout" in billing context** - Correctly refers to "Stripe Checkout" (proper noun/product name)
2. **"checkout" in GitHub Actions** - Correctly refers to `actions/checkout` (technical term)
3. **Technical terms in code** - Various technical terms that might look like typos but are correct in their context

## Search Methodology

1. **Automated Pattern Matching**: Used regex patterns to search for common misspellings
2. **Brand Name Verification**: Checked for proper capitalization of brand names like "GitHub"
3. **Context Analysis**: Manually reviewed each potential typo to determine if it was actually incorrect
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Searched across all documentation types (.md, .mdc files)

## Files Examined

- Main README files (English, Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
- Contributing guidelines
- Cursor AI rules and documentation
- GitHub templates and workflows
- Feature-specific README files
- Security and license documentation

## Conclusion

The Langfuse documentation is generally well-written with very few typos. The project already uses automated spell checking (codespell) which helps maintain documentation quality. The typos found were minor but important for maintaining professional presentation, particularly the GitHub brand name correction across multiple language versions of the README.

All identified typos have been corrected while preserving the correct usage of technical terms and proper nouns that might superficially appear to be misspellings.
