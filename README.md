# 🤖 Features

Short walkthrough to help getting an overview of the project, who it is useful for, and how it is integrated with your application.

## 1. Monitor usage

- Stay on top of trends in output quality and feature adoption
- Track token usage by feature, user, and model (coming soon)

## 2. Understand and segment use cases

- LLM-based features can be used in all sorts of ways. With langfuse, you can easily segment executions by user attributes, scores, and other dimensions.
- Model-based clustering of use cases to help understand how users are using the features (coming soon)

## 3. Identify quality bottlenecks

- Compare low-quality executions side-by-side to gain a deep understanding on why chains did not perform well
- Model-based comparison of executions with automated suggestions (coming soon)

## 4. Built your data moat (coming soon)

- Retrieval API to query prompts/completions based on similarity to current prompt
- Exports of high-quality prompt/completions for fine tuning; e.g. use GPT-4 completions to train own Llama models
