### Develop

- **Observability:** Instrument your app and start ingesting traces to Langfuse ([Quickstart](https://langfuse.com/docs/get-started), [Integrations](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations) [Tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing))
- **Langfuse UI:** Inspect and debug complex logs ([Demo](https://langfuse.com/docs/demo), [Tracing](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing))
- **Prompt Management:** Manage, version and deploy prompts from within Langfuse ([Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts/get-started))
- **Prompt Engineering:** Test and iterate on your prompts with the [LLM Playground](https://langfuse.com/docs/playground)

### Monitor

- **Analytics:** Track metrics (cost, latency, quality) and gain insights from dashboards & data exports ([Analytics](https://langfuse.com/docs/analytics))
- **Evals:** Collect and calculate scores for your LLM completions ([Scores & Evaluations](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores))
  - Run model-based evaluations ([Model-based evaluations](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/model-based-evals)) within Langfuse
  - Collect user feedback ([User Feedback](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/user-feedback))
  - Manually score observations in Langfuse ([Manual Scores](https://langfuse.com/docs/scores/manually))

### Test

- **Experiments:** Track and test app behaviour before deploying a new version
  - Datasets let you test expected in and output pairs and benchmark performance before deploying ([Datasets](https://langfuse.com/docs/datasets))
  - Track versions and releases in your application ([Experimentation](https://langfuse.com/docs/experimentation), [Prompt Management](https://langfuse.com/docs/prompts))

## Get started

### Langfuse Cloud

Managed deployment by the Langfuse team, generous free-tier (hobby plan), no credit card required.

**[» Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com)**

### Localhost (docker)

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/langfuse/langfuse.git
cd langfuse

# Run server and database
docker compose up -d
```

[→ Learn more about deploying locally](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/local)

### Self-host (docker)

Langfuse is simple to self-host and keep updated. It currently requires only a single docker container.
[→ Self Hosting Instructions](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/self-host)

Templated deployments: [Railway, GCP Cloud Run, AWS Fargate, Kubernetes and others](https://langfuse.com/docs/deployment/self-host#platform-specific-information)

## Get Started

### API Keys

You need a Langfuse public and secret key to get started. Sign up [here](https://cloud.langfuse.com) and find them in your project settings.

### Ingesting Data · Instrumenting Your Application

Note: We recommend using our fully async, typed [SDKs](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk) that allow you to instrument any LLM application with any underlying model. They are available in [Python (Decorators)](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/python) & [JS/TS](https://langfuse.com/docs/sdk/typescript). The SDKs will always be the most fully featured and stable way to ingest data into Langfuse.

You may want to use another integration to get started quickly or implement a use case that we do not yet support. However, we recommend to migrate to the Langfuse SDKs over time to ensure performance and stability.

See the [→ Quickstart](https://langfuse.com/docs/get-started) to integrate Langfuse.

## Misc

### GET API to export your data

[**GET routes**](https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/api) to use data in downstream applications (e.g. embedded analytics).

### Security & Privacy

We take data security and privacy seriously. Please refer to our [Security and Privacy](https://langfuse.com/security) page for more information.

### Telemetry

By default, Langfuse automatically reports basic usage statistics of self-hosted instances to a centralized server (PostHog).

This helps us to:

1. Understand how Langfuse is used and improve the most relevant features.
2. Track overall usage for internal and external (e.g. fundraising) reporting.

None of the data is shared with third parties and does not include any sensitive information. We want to be super transparent about this and you can find the exact data we collect [here](/web/src/features/telemetry/index.ts).

You can opt-out by setting `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`.
